## What's new?
- QoL changes.
- Likely the same as [SRB2-Snowy](https://github.com/JadenArc/SRB2-Snowy), so you can get what is inside of this.

## What are the changes?
- Being able to open the console on Menus,
- Scoreboard in the voting sessions,
- RA's Input Display, being everywhere,
- "Better" Menus,
- And some minimal HUD changes.
